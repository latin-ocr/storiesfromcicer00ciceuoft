INTRODUCTION.

LIFE OF CICERO.¹

Marcus Tullius Cicero was born on the :3rd of January,
nc. 106, near Arpinum, a town of Latium, the birthplace
also of Marius. His father, who was a member of the
equestrian order, had him educated at Rome by the best
Greek teachers to be found there. After assuming, at the
age of fifteen, the coya virilia, Cicero devoted himself to the
study of law, under the care of Mucius Scaevola, the augur.

struggle between Marius and Sulla, devoting himself to the
diligent pursuit of his studies in law and rhetoric, as well as
in philosophy. In B.C. 81, at the age of twenty-five, he began
his practice as a barrister, appearing in defence of P. Quinc-

a criminal case, pro Roscio Amerino. (It must be remem—

fees for his services, though there was nothing to prevent a
grateful client from making a handsome present to his counsel,
or leaving him a snbstantial legacy. In fact Cicero (Phil. ii.
40) declares that he received no less than 20,000,000 sestertii„
or about 2617o‚000 in bequests.)

In B.c. 79 he left Rome, and after speuding six months at
Athens, made a prolonged tour in Asia Minor; the next year
he went to Rhodes to study rhetoric, and at length returned
home, after an absence of two years, and resumed his practice
at the Bar, where he soon outshone his rivals, Hortensius amL
