he was obliged to leave Rome in April s.c. 68 and to seek
refuge at Thessalonica, aud subsequently at Dyrrachium.
Soon after this Pompey quarrelled with Clodius; and this
quaml, coupled with the efforts of his friends, led to Cicero's
triumphant return in the autumn of the next year. From
lm. 57 to 52 he was busily occupied with professional duties,
and took but little part in public affairs. In n.c. 53 he was
admitted to the college of augurs, and in Rc. 52 he was sent out,
though much against his will, as governor of Cilicia, in which
capacity he distinguished himself by the remarkable modera-
tion and striet integrity of his rule. He returned to Rome
at the beginning of 13.c. 49, just when the Civil VVar was on
the point of breaking out, and after much hesitation, threw in

for a time, but soon returned, and in the early part of the
next year he delivered his famous Phihppics, in which he
furiously attacked Autony; but when the second triumvirate

Campania, by Antony's soldiers, who cut off his head and
hands and sent them to Rome, December ac. 43.

In his public career down to the close of his consulship,
Cicero gave promise of becoming a great power in the state;
but from that time onwards he showed himself destitute of
almost all the qualities necessary to make a statesman; he
was weak and irresolute, and what we should call a political
“hedger”. But in private life he was undoubtedly a most
estimable man, a good son, a kind father, an indulgent master,
and a loyal friend; “those who have known him most inti-
mately have commonly loved him best. He is no demi-god
to be set on a pedestal for the worship of the nations, but a
man with human virtues and human weaknesses, and withal
