8 STORIES FROM CICERO.

Cotta. During the year ac. 75 he served as quaestor in Sicily,
and on his return he again became busily engaged in the
eourts; but none of his speeches made during the next four
years are now extant. The next important trial in which he
was engaged was the impeachnient of Verres for extortion
while praetor of Sicily; and so strong a case did Cicero make
out against him that Verres retired into exile without attempt-
ing to defend himself. Cicero was aedile for the year B.c. 69
and praetor in Rc. 66, in the course of which he made his first
political speech in support of the Lex Manilia, a bill proposing
to give Pompey the sole command of the war with Mithra-
dates. His great ambition now was to gain the consulship;
and. this he secured in B.C. 63, a year memorable for the
famous conspiracy of Catiline, which was baffled by Cicero‘s
prudence and courage. “Men of all ranks and all parties
hailed him as the saviour of his country, and honours were
showered down upon him such as no citizen of Rome had ever

brought to trial for sacrilege, and largely through Cicero's
efforts his guilt was conclusively proved3 but in spite of this
the accused was acquitted, and at once set to work to take
vengeance upon Cicero. To accomplish his purpose the more
readily Clodius got himself elected tribune in B.c. 59, and
brought in a bill for the banishment of any one who should
have put to death a Roman citizen without trial. Cicero, by
way of arousing public sympathy, put on mourning and went
round the forum canvassing for acquittal. But as the trium-
virs, Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus, each refused to help him,
