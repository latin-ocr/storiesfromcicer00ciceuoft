PREFACE.

 

In compiling these extracts from Cicero I have tried to
choose stories which may be at once fairly easy aud fairly
interesting in themselves. With many of them boys will be
already more 01· less familiar from having met thern in Roman
history or elsewhere. The sentences for re-translation into
Latin are mostly either paraphrases from the corresponding
pieces in the text, or they contain similar constructions and
phrases. I have seldom referred to grammars in illustration
of points of syntax, for two reasons: partly because of the
diversity of grammars used in schools, but chiefly because, so
far as my experience goes, tlte very last thing our old friend,
“the average fourth-form b0y”‚ thinks of doing is to look up
the references kindly provided for his instruction, even if he
has the books referred to.

With the exception of a few omissions no liberties have

been taken with the text. A C L
